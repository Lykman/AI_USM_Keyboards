# AI USM Keyboards

An advanced virtual keyboard system using AI for hand gesture detection and interaction, developed with Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and other supporting libraries. Created in collaboration with [smbtk-ops](https://github.com/smbtk-ops).

## Project Description

This project uses AI to recognize hand gestures and convert them into input for a virtual keyboard interface. It combines computer vision and machine learning techniques for a touchless typing experience.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Pygame
- Pynput
- Pillow
