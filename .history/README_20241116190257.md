# AI USM Keyboards

An advanced virtual keyboard system using AI for hand gesture detection and interaction, built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe. This project is developed in collaboration with [smbtk-ops](https://github.com/smbtk-ops).

## Description

AI USM Keyboards leverages computer vision and machine learning to create a virtual keyboard that responds to hand gestures for an interactive typing experience. The system uses a combination of OpenCV for image processing, Mediapipe for hand tracking, and Pygame for rendering virtual elements.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Pygame
- Pynput
- Pillow

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
